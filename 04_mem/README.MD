## 4.3. Cache Memory
System architecture diagram showing caches, ALU (arithmetic logic unit), main memory, 
and the buses connected each component:

![System Architecture Diagram Showing Cache Levels](./images/sys_arch_diag_cache.png)

The concept of L1 and L2 (and even L3) cache is further illustrated by the following 
figure, which shows a multi-core CPU and its interplay with L1, L2 and L3 caches:

![L1, L2, L3 Cache](./images/l1_l2_l3_cache.png)

In the above figure:
* L1d and L1i represent memory space for data and instructions respectively.
* Size
  * L1: 16 to 64 kBytes
  * L2: at or below 2 megabytes
* **Level 3 Caches** is shared among all cores of a multicore processor. With the L3 cache, 
  the [cache coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherence) protocol of multicore 
  processors can work much faster. This protocol compares the caches of all cores to maintain
  data consistency so that all processors have access to the same data at the same time. 
  The L3 cache therefore has less the function of a cache, but is intended to simplify and 
  accelerate the cache coherence protocol and the data exchange between the cores.

Command to know cache information on linux:
```
lscpu | grep cache
```

### 4.3.1. Temporal and Spatial Locality
* **Temporal Locality** means that address ranges that are accessed are likely to be used 
  again in the near future. In the course of time, the same memory address is accessed relatively 
  frequently (e.g. in a loop). This property can be used at all levels of the memory hierarchy to 
  keep memory areas accessible as quickly as possible.
* **Spatial Locality** means that after an access to an address range, the next access to an 
  address in the immediate vicinity is highly probable (e.g. in arrays). In the course of time, 
  memory addresses that are very close to each other are accessed again multiple times. This 
  can be exploited by moving the adjacent address areas upwards into the next hierarchy level 
  during a memory access.

## 4.4. Virtual Memory
### 4.4.1. Problems with Physical Mermory
* The idea of virtual memory stems back from a (not so long ago) time, when the random access 
  memory (RAM) of most computers was severely limited. Programers needed to treat memory as a 
  precious resource and use it most efficiently. Also, they wanted to be able to run programs 
  even if there was not enough RAM available.
* **Holes in address space**: If several programs are started one after the other and then 
  shortly afterwards some of these are terminated again, it must be ensured that the freed-up 
  space in between the remaining programs does not remain unused. If memory becomes too fragmented, 
  it might not be possible to allocate a large block of memory due to a large-enough free contiguous 
  block not being available any more.
* **Programs writing over each other**: If several programs are allowed to access the same memory 
  address, they will overwrite each others' data at this location. In some cases, this might even 
  lead to one program reading sensitive information (e.g. bank account info) that was written by 
  another program. This problem is of particular concern when writing concurrent programs which 
  run several threads at the same time.

The basic idea of virtual memory is to separate the addresses a program may use from the addresses 
in physical computer memory. By using a mapping function, an access to (virtual) program memory 
can be redirected to a real address which is guaranteed to be protected from other programs.

![Virtual Memory Idea](./images/virtual_mem.png)

With virtual memory, the RAM acts as a cache for the virtual memory space which resides on 
secondary storage devices.

1) In a nutshell, virtual memory guarantees us a fixed-size address space which is largely independent 
of the system configuration. Also, 2) the **OS** guarantees that the virtual address spaces of different 
programs do not interfere with each other.

* A **memory page** is a number of directly successive memory locations in virtual memory defined by the 
  computer architecture and by the operating system. The computer memory is divided into memory pages of 
  equal size. The use of memory pages enables the operating system to perform virtual memory management. 
  The entire working memory is divided into tiles and each address in this computer architecture is interpreted 
  by the *Memory Management Unit (MMU)* as a logical address and converted into a physical address.
* A **memory frame** is mostly identical to the concept of a memory page with the key difference being 
  its location in the physical main memory instead of the virtual memory.

![Memory Page and Frame](./images/mem_page_frame.png)

As can be seen, both processes have their own virtual memory space. Some of the pages are mapped to 
frames in the physical memory and some are not. If process 1 needs to use memory in the memory page 
that starts at address 0x1000, a page fault will occur if the required data is not there. The memory 
page will then be mapped to a vacant memory frame in physical memory. Also, note that the virtual 
memory addresses are not the same as the physical addresses. The first memory page of process 1, 
which starts at the virtual address 0x0000, is mapped to a memory frame that starts at the physical 
address 0x2000.

In summary, virtual memory management is performed by the operating system and programmers do usually 
not interfere with this process. The major benefit is a unique perspective on a chunk of memory for 
each program that is only limited in its size by the architecture of the system (32 bit, 64 bit) and 
by the available physical memory, including the hard disk.

## 4.5. The Process Memory Model
  
Each program is assigned its own virtual memory by the operating system. This address space is arranged 
in a linear fashion with one block of data being stored at each address. It is also divided into several 
distinct areas as illustrated by the figure below:

![The Process Memory Model](./images/process_memory_model.png)

In a 32-bit computer, the address space has 32 bits and hence `2^32` entries, while in a 64-bit system,
the address space has 64 bits which is a very (close to unlimited!) memory space.

In the above figure, *Text* block contains the programs and instructions generated by compiler and linker. 
In addition the *OS Kernel Space* includes the kernel code which is controlled by OS.

* **Stack**
  * The stack is a contiguous memory block with a fixed maximum size.
  * If a program exceeds this size, it will crash.
  * The stack is used for storing automatically allocated variables such as local variables or function parameters.
  * If there are multiple threads in a program, then each thread has its own stack memory.
  * New memory on the stack is allocated when the path of execution enters a scope and freed again once the scope is left.
  * It is important to know that the stack is managed "automatically" by the compiler, which means we do not have 
    to concern ourselves with allocation and deallocation.
* **Heap**
  * The heap (also called "free store" in C++) is where data with dynamic storage lives. 
  * It is shared among multiple threads in a program, which means that memory management 
    for the heap needs to take concurrency into account. This makes memory allocations in 
    the heap more complicated than stack allocations.
  * In general, managing memory on the heap is more (computationally) expensive for the 
    operating system, which makes it slower than stack memory.
  * Contrary to the stack, the heap is not managed automatically by the system, but by the programmer.
  * If memory is allocated on the heap, it is the programmerâ€™s responsibility to free it again when it 
    is no longer needed. If the programmer manages the heap poorly or not at all, there will be trouble.

* **The BSS (Block Started by Symbol)**
  * The BSS segment is used in many compilers and linkers for a segment that contains global and static 
    variables that are initialized with zero values.
  * This memory area is suitable, for example, for arrays that are **not initialized** with predefined values.

* **Data**
  * The data segment serves the same purpose as the BSS segment with the major difference being that 
    variables in the Data segment have been **initialized** with a value other than zero.
  * Memory for variables in the Data segment (and in BSS) is allocated once when a program is 
    run and persists throughout its lifetime.

## 4.6. Memory Allocation in C++
*Allocating* a memory space to a variable name means there is a memory space assigned to that variable. 
*Deallocating* means when the system has no longer any claim on that space by the variable name.

Generally, three types of memory allocation is supported:
1. **Static** memory allocation is performed for static and global variables, which are stored in 
  the BSS and Data segment. Memory for these types of variables is allocated once when your 
  program is run and persists throughout the life of your program.

2. **Automatic** memory allocation is performed for function parameters as well as local variables, 
  which are stored on the stack. Memory for these types of variables is allocated when the path 
  of execution enters a scope and freed again once the scope is left.

3. **Dynamic** memory allocation is a possibility for programs to request memory from the operating 
  system at runtime when needed. This is the major difference to automatic and static allocation, 
  where the size of the variable must be known at compile time. Dynamic memory allocation is not 
  performed on the limited stack but on the heap and is thus (almost) only limited by the size of 
  the address space.

## 4.7. Automatic Memory Allocation (The Stack)
The stack is the place in virtual memory where the local variables reside, including arguments to 
functions. Each time a function is called, the stack grows (from top to bottom) and each time a 
function returns, the stack contracts. When using multiple threads (as in concurrent programming), 
it is important to know that each thread has its own stack memory - which can be considered thread-safe.

1. The stack is a **contiguous block of memory**. It will not become fragmented (as opposed to the heap) 
  and it has a fixed maximum size.
2. When the **maximum size** of the stack memory is exceeded, a program will crash.
3. Allocating and deallocating memory is **fast** on the stack. It only involves moving the stack pointer 
  to a new position.

To check the stack size on linux machine run:
```
ulimit -s
```

## 4.8. Call by Reference vs. Call by Value
Drawbacks of passing by value:
1. Passing parameters by value means that a copy is created, which is an expensive operation that might 
  consume large amounts of memory, depending on the data that is being transferred. Later in we will 
  encounter "move semantics", which is an effective way to compensate for this downside.
2. Passing by value also means that the created copy can not be used as a back channel for communicating 
  with the caller, for example by directly writing the desired information into the variable.

We can create a back channel between caller and callee by a pointer. If a function gets a pointer as 
an argument, then by passing the address of a variable the function can modify the variable within 
the function. However, the first drawback still exist since the function creates a local variable 
containing the address of its argument. Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void AddThree(int *val)
{
    *val += 3;
}

int main()
{
    int val = 0;
    AddThree(&val);
    val += 2;

    std::cout << "val = " << val << std::endl;
 
    return 0;
}
```

In contrast, in passing by reference the function receives a reference to the parameter, rather than 
a copy of its value. The function can now modify the argument such that the changes also happen on 
the caller side. Passing by reference is faster as no information needs to be copied and less stack 
memory required. Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void AddFour(int &val)
{
    val += 4;
}

int main()
{
    int val = 0;
    AddFour(val);
    val += 2;

    std::cout << "val = " << val << std::endl;
 
    return 0;
}
```

### 4.8.1. Pointers vs. References
* Pointers can be declared without initialization. This means we can pass an uninitialized pointer 
  to a function who then internally performs the initialization for us.
* Pointers can be reassigned to another memory block on the heap.
* References are usually easier to use (depending on the expertise level of the programmer). 
  Sometimes however, if a third-party function is used without properly looking at the 
  parameter definition, it might go unnoticed that a value has been modified.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void AddFour(int &val){   //pasing by reference
    val += 4;
}

void AddSix(int *val){    //passing by pointer
    *val += 6; 
}

int main(){
    int val = 0;
    AddFour(val);
    AddSix(&val);

    std::cout << "val = " << val << std::endl;
 
    return 0;
}
```

### 4.8.2. Three ways to pass a value to a function

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
    
void CallByValue(int i){
    int j = 1; 
    printf ("call-by-value: %p\n",&j);
}

void CallByPointer(int *i){
    int j = 1; 
    printf ("call-by-pointer: %p\n",&j);
}

void CallByReference(int &i){
    int j = 1; 
    printf ("call-by-reference: %p\n",&j);
}

int main(){
    int i = 0;
    printf ("stack bottom: %p\n",&i); //as the bottom of stack address
    
    CallByValue(i);
    CallByPointer(&i);
    CallByReference(i);  //from here we cannot say whether it's pass by value or reference?!!

    return 0;
}
```

After running the above code, we expect the `CallByValue()` takes more space on the stack, 
however, it's not the case always. The reason is if the system is a 64-bit computer, the 
size of pointer is 8 bytes and the size of the value itself is 4 bytes. 

In order to benefit from call-by-reference, the size of the data type passed to the function 
has to surpass the size of the pointer on the respective architecture (i.e. 32 bit or 64 bit).

## 4.9. Heap Memory
* As opposed to local variables on the stack, memory can now be allocated in an arbitrary scope 
  (e.g. inside a function) without it being deleted when the scope is left. Thus, as long as the 
  address to an allocated block of memory is returned by a function, the caller can freely use it.

* Local variables on the stack are allocated at **compile-time**. Thus, the size of e.g. a string 
  variable might not be appropriate as the length of the string will not be known until the program 
  is executed and the user inputs it. With local variables, a solution would be to allocate a 
  long-enough array of and hope that the actual length does not exceed the buffer size. With dynamically 
  allocated heap memory, variables are allocated at **run-time**. This means that the size of the 
  above-mentioned string variable can be tailored to the actual length of the user input.

* Heap memory is only constrained by the size of the address space and by the available memory. With 
  modern 64 bit operating systems and large RAM memory and hard disks the programmer commands a vast 
  amount of memory. However, if the programmer forgets to deallocate a block of heap memory, it will 
  remain unused until the program is terminated. This is called a **memory leak**.

* Unlike the stack, the heap is **shared** among multiple **threads**, which means that memory management 
  for the heap needs to take concurrency into account as several threads might compete for the same 
  memory resource.

* When memory is allocated or deallocated on the stack, the stack pointer is simply shifted upwards or downwards. 
  Due to the sequential structure of stack memory management, stack memory can be managed (by the operating 
  system) easily and securely. With heap memory, allocation and deallocation can occur arbitrarily, depending 
  on the lifetime of the variables. This can result in **fragmented memory** over time, which is much more 
  difficult and expensive to manage.

### 4.9.1. Memory Fragmentation
A classic symptom of memory fragmentation is that you try to allocate a large block and you canâ€™t, 
even though you appear to have enough memory free. On systems with virtual memory however, this 
is less of a problem, because large allocations only need to be contiguous in virtual address space, 
not in physical address space.

When memory is heavily fragmented however, memory allocations will likely take longer because the memory 
allocator has to do more work to find a suitable space for the new object.

## 4.10. Using `malloc` and `free`
To reserve memory on the heap, one of the two functions `malloc` (stands for *Memory Allocation*) or 
`calloc` (stands for *Cleared Memory Allocation*) is used. The header file `stdlib.h` or `malloc.h` 
must be included to use the functions.

Here is the syntax of malloc and calloc in C/C++:

```cpp
pointer_name = (cast-type*) malloc(size);
pointer_name = (cast-type*) calloc(num_elems, size_elem);
```

`malloc` is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size. 
It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form.

`calloc` is used to dynamically allocate the specified number of blocks of memory of the specified 
type. It initializes each block with a default value '0'.

Both functions return a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form. 
If the space for the allocation is insufficient, a NULL pointer is returned.

Example:
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    int i; 
    double d; 
    char a[5];
};

MyStruct *p = (MyStruct*)calloc(4,sizeof(MyStruct));
p[0].i = 1; p[0].d = 3.14159; p[0].a[0] = 'a';
```

The size of the memory area reserved with `malloc` or `calloc` can be increased or decreased 
with the `realloc` function.

```cpp
pointer_name = (cast-type*) realloc( (cast-type*)old_memblock, new_size );
```

We can use `free` function to free the allocated memory on the heap using `malloc` or 
`calloc` as the following example:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    void *p = malloc(100); 
    free(p);

    return 0;
}
```

### 4.10.1. Dangling Pointer
In the following example, a pointer `p` is copied into a new variable `p2`, which is then passed to 
`free` AFTER the original pointer has been already released.

```
free(41143,0x1000a55c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x1003001f0: pointer being freed was not allocated.
```

In the workspace, you will see this error:

```
*** Error in './a.out': double free or corruption (fasttop): 0x0000000000755010 ***
```

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    void *p = malloc(100); 
    void *p2 = p;
    
    free(p); // OK
    free(p2); // ERROR

    return 0;
}
```

The pointer `p2` in the example is invalid as soon as `free(p)` is called. It still holds the address 
to the memory location which has been freed, but may not access it anymore. Such a pointer is 
called a "**dangling pointer**".

Memory allocated with `malloc` or `calloc` is not subject to the familiar rules of variables in their 
respective scopes. This means that they exist independently of block limits until they are released again 
or the program is terminated. However, the pointers which refer to such heap-allocated memory are created 
on the stack and thus only exist within a limited scope. As soon as the scope is left, the pointer variable 
will be lost - but not the heap memory it refers to.

## 4.11. Using `new` and `delete`
`new` and `delete` are operators while `malloc` and `free` are library function.

If we were to create a C++ object with `malloc`, the constructor and destructor of such an object 
would not be called.

1. **Constructors / Destructors**: Unlike `malloc( sizeof(MyClass) )`, the call `new MyClass()` calls 
  the constructor. Similarly, delete calls the destructor.
2. **Type safety**: `malloc` returns a void pointer, which needs to be cast into the appropriate 
  data type it points to. This is not type safe, as you can freely vary the pointer type without 
  any warnings or errors from the compiler as in the following small example:
  ```MyObject *p = (MyObject*)malloc(sizeof(int));```
3. **Operator Overloading**: As `malloc` and `free` are functions defined in a library, their behavior 
  can not be changed easily. The new and delete operators however can be overloaded by a class in order 
  to include optional proprietary behavior.

As with with `malloc` and `new`, a call to `new` has to be followed by a call to `delete`. 
Otherwise it will yields to *memory leak*.

```cpp
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <iostream>

class MyClass
{
private:
    int *_number;

public:
    MyClass()
    {
        std::cout << "Allocate memory\n";
        _number = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    }
    ~MyClass()
    {
        std::cout << "Delete memory\n";
        free(_number);
    }
    void setNumber(int number)
    {
        *_number = number;
        std::cout << "Number: " << _number << "\n";
    }
};


int main()
{
    // allocate memory using malloc
    // will throw error, because _number has not been allocated yet.
    MyClass *myClass = (MyClass *)malloc(sizeof(MyClass));
    myClass->setNumber(42); // EXC_BAD_ACCESS
    free(myClass);
	  
	// allocate memory using new
    MyClass *myClass = new MyClass();
    myClass->setNumber(42); // works as expected
    delete myClass;

    return 0;
}
```

### 4.11.1. Optimizing performance with `palcement new`
In some cases, it makes sense to separate memory allocation from object construction. 
Consider a case where we need to reconstruct an object several times. If we were to 
use the standard `new`/`delete` construct, memory would be allocated and freed unnecessarily 
as only the content of the memory block changes but not its size. By separating allocation from 
construction, we can get a significant performance increase.

C++ allows us to do this by using a construct called `placement new`: With `placement new`, 
we can pass a preallocated memory and construct an object at that memory location. 
Consider the following code:
```cpp
void *memory = malloc(sizeof(MyClass));
MyClass *object = new (memory) MyClass;
```
The syntax `new (memory)` is denoted as placement new. The difference to the "conventional" new 
we have been using so far is that no memory is allocated. The call constructs an object and 
places it in the assigned memory location. There is however, no delete equivalent to placement new, 
so we have to call the **destructor** explicitly in this case instead of using `delete` as we would 
have done with a regular call to new:
```cpp
object->~MyClass();
free(memory);
```

### 4.11.2. Overloading `new` and `delete`
One advantage of `new`/`delete` over `malloc`/`free` is that we can overload `new`/`delete` and change
their behavior.

The syntax for overloading the new and delete operator looks as follows
```cpp
void* operator new(size_t size);
void operator delete(void*);
```

Example: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>

class MyClass
{
    int _mymember;

public:
    MyClass()
    {
        std::cout << "Constructor is called\n";
    }

    ~MyClass()
    {
        std::cout << "Destructor is called\n";
    }

    void *operator new(size_t size)
    {
        std::cout << "new: Allocating " << size << " bytes of memory" << std::endl;
        void *p = malloc(size);

        return p;
    }

    void operator delete(void *p)
    {
        std::cout << "delete: Memory is freed again " << std::endl;
        free(p);
    }
};

int main()
{
    MyClass *p = new MyClass();
    delete p;
}
```

### 4.11.3. Overloading `new[]` and `delete[]`
we can use the following code to create an array of objects:
```cpp
void* operator new[](size_t size);
void operator delete[](void*);
```

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>

class MyClass
{
    int _mymember;

public:
    MyClass()
    {
        std::cout << "Constructor is called\n";
    }

    ~MyClass()
    {
        std::cout << "Destructor is called\n";
    }

    void *operator new[](size_t size)
    {
        std::cout << "new: Allocating " << size << " bytes of memory" << std::endl;
        void *p = malloc(size);

        return p;
    }

    void operator delete[](void *p)
    {
        std::cout << "delete: Memory is freed again " << std::endl;
        free(p);
    }
};

int main()
{
    MyClass *p = new MyClass[3]();
    delete[] p;
}
```

The output for the above code looks as follows:
```
new: Allocating 20 bytes of memory
Constructor is called
Constructor is called
Constructor is called
Destructor is called
Destructor is called
Destructor is called
delete: Memory is freed again 
```

Interestingly, the memory requirement is larger than expected: With new, the block size was 4 bytes, 
which is exactly the space required for a single integer. Thus, with three integers, it should now 
be 12 bytes instead of 20 bytes. The reason for this is the memory allocation overhead that the compiler 
needs to keep track of the allocated blocks of memory - which in itself consumes memory. If we change 
the above call to e.g. `new MyClass[100]()`, we will see that the overhead of 8 bytes does not change:

```
new: Allocating 408 bytes of memory
Constructor is called
â€¦
Destructor is called
delete: Memory is freed again 
```

### 4.11.4. Reasons for overloading `new` and `delete`
1. The overloaded new operator function allows to add additional parameters. 
  Therefore, a class can have multiple overloaded new operator functions. This gives the 
  programmer more flexibility in customizing the memory allocation for objects.
2. Overloaded the new and delete operators provides an easy way to integrate a mechanism 
  similar to garbage collection capabilities (such as in Java).
3. By adding exception handling capabilities into new and delete, the code can be made more robust.
4. It is very easy to add customized behavior, such as overwriting deallocated memory with zeros in 
  order to increase the security of critical application data.

## 4.12. Overview of memory management problems
* Memory Leaks
* Buffer Overruns
* Uninitialized Memory: Generally, a variable will be automatically initialized in these cases:
  * it is a class instance where the default constructor initializes all primitive types
  * array initializer syntax is used, such as `int a[10] = {}`
  * it is a global or extern variable
  * it is defined `static`
* Incorrect pairing of allocation and deallocation
* Invalid memory access

## 4.13. Copy Semantics
The default behavior of both *copy constructor* and *assignment operator* is to perform a 
**shallow** copy as with the example above.

![Shallow Copy](./images/shallow_copy.png)

Fortunately, in C++, the copying process can be controlled by defining a tailored copy constructor 
as well as a copy assignment operator. The copying process must be closely linked to the respective 
resource release mechanism and is often referred to as *copy-ownership policy*. Tailoring the copy 
constructor according to your memory management policy is an important choice you often need to make 
when designing a class.

### 4.13.1. No Copying Policy
The simplest policy of all is to forbid copying and assigning class instances all together. 
This can be achieved by 1) declaring, but not defining a private copy constructor and assignment 
operator OR 2) alternatively by making both public and assigning the delete operator. 

The second choice is more explicit and makes it clearer to the programmer that copying has been 
actively forbidden.

```cpp
class NoCopyClass1
{
private:
    NoCopyClass1(const NoCopyClass1 &);
    NoCopyClass1 &operator=(const NoCopyClass1 &);

public:
    NoCopyClass1(){};
};

class NoCopyClass2
{
public:
    NoCopyClass2(){}
    NoCopyClass2(const NoCopyClass2 &) = delete;
    NoCopyClass2 &operator=(const NoCopyClass2 &) = delete;
};

int main()
{
    NoCopyClass1 original1;
    NoCopyClass1 copy1a(original1); // copy câ€™tor
    NoCopyClass1 copy1b = original1; // assigment operator

    NoCopyClass2 original2;
    NoCopyClass2 copy2a(original2); // copy câ€™tor
    NoCopyClass2 copy2b = original2; // assigment operator

    return 0;
}
```

On compiling, we get the following error messages:

```
error: calling a private constructor of class 'NoCopyClass1'
    NoCopyClass1 copy1(original1);
    NoCopyClass1 copy1b = original1; 

error: call to deleted constructor of 'NoCopyClass2'
    NoCopyClass2 copy2(original2);
    NoCopyClass2 copy2b = original2; 
```

Both cases effectively prevent the original object from being copied or assigned. 
In the C++11 standard library, there are some classes for multi-threaded synchronization which 
use the no copying policy.

### 4.13.2. Exclusive Ownership Policy
This policy states that whenever a resource management object is copied, the resource handle 
is transferred from the source pointer to the destination pointer. In the process, the source 
pointer is set to `nullptr` to make ownership exclusive. At any time, the resource handle belongs 
only to a single object, which is responsible for its deletion when it is no longer needed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class ExclusiveCopy
{
private:
    int *_myInt;

public:
    ExclusiveCopy()
    {
        _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
        std::cout << "resource allocated" << std::endl;
    }
    ~ExclusiveCopy()
    {
        if (_myInt != nullptr)
        {
            free(_myInt);
            std::cout << "resource freed" << std::endl;
        }
            
    }
    ExclusiveCopy(ExclusiveCopy &source)
    {
        _myInt = source._myInt;
        source._myInt = nullptr;
    }
    ExclusiveCopy &operator=(ExclusiveCopy &source)
    {
        _myInt = source._myInt;
        source._myInt = nullptr;
        return *this;
    }
};

int main()
{
    ExclusiveCopy source;
    ExclusiveCopy destination(source);

    return 0;
}
```

This example is not the way exclusive ownership is handled in the standard template library. 
One problem in this implementation is that for a short time there are effectively two valid 
handles to the same resource - after the handle has been copied and before it is set to `nullptr`. 
In concurrent programs, this would cause a data **race** for the resource. A much better alternative 
to handle exclusive ownership in C++ would be to use move semantics.

### 4.13.3. Deep Copying Policy
With this policy, copying and assigning class instances to each other is possible without the 
danger of resource conflicts. The idea is to allocate proprietary memory in the destination object 
and then to copy the content to which the source object handle is pointing into the newly allocated 
block of memory. This way, the content is preserved during copy or assignment. However, this approach 
increases the memory demands and the uniqueness of the data is lost: After the deep copy has been made, 
two versions of the same resource exist in memory.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class DeepCopy
{
private:
    int *_myInt;

public:
    DeepCopy(int val)
    {
        _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
        *_myInt = val;
        std::cout << "resource allocated at address " << _myInt << std::endl;
    }
    ~DeepCopy()
    {
        free(_myInt);
        std::cout << "resource freed at address " << _myInt << std::endl;
    }
    DeepCopy(DeepCopy &source)
    {
        _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
        *_myInt = *source._myInt;
        std::cout << "resource allocated at address " << _myInt << " with _myInt = " << *_myInt << std::endl;
    }
    DeepCopy &operator=(DeepCopy &source)
    {
        _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
        std::cout << "resource allocated at address " << _myInt << " with _myInt=" << *_myInt << std::endl;
        *_myInt = *source._myInt;
        return *this;
    }
};

int main()
{
    DeepCopy source(42);
    DeepCopy dest1(source);
    DeepCopy dest2 = dest1;

    return 0;
}
```

The output of the program looks like the following:

```
resource allocated at address 0x100300060
resource allocated at address 0x100300070 with _myInt = 42
resource allocated at address 0x100300080 with _myInt = 42
resource freed at address 0x100300080
resource freed at address 0x100300070
resource freed at address 0x100300060
```

As can be seen, all copies have the same value of 42 while the address of the handle 
differs between `source`, `dest1` and `dest2`.

### 4.13.4. Shared Ownership Policy
The idea is to perform a copy or assignment similar to the default behavior, i.e. copying 
the handle instead of the content (as with a shallow copy) while at the same time keeping 
track of the number of instances that also point to the same resource. Each time an instance 
goes out of scope, the counter is decremented. Once the last object is about to be deleted, 
it can safely deallocate the memory resource. We will see later in this course that this is 
the central idea of `unique_ptr`, which is a representative of the group of smart pointers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class SharedCopy
{
private:
    int *_myInt;
    static int _cnt;

public:
    SharedCopy(int val);
    ~SharedCopy();
    SharedCopy(SharedCopy &source);
};

int SharedCopy::_cnt = 0;

SharedCopy::SharedCopy(int val)
{
    _myInt = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *_myInt = val;
    ++_cnt;
    std::cout << "resource allocated at address " << _myInt << std::endl;
}

SharedCopy::~SharedCopy()
{
    --_cnt;
    if (_cnt == 0)
    {
        free(_myInt);
        std::cout << "resource freed at address " << _myInt << std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "instance at address " << this << " goes out of scope with _cnt = " << _cnt << std::endl;
    }
}

SharedCopy::SharedCopy(SharedCopy &source)
{
    _myInt = source._myInt;
    ++_cnt;
    std::cout << _cnt << " instances with handles to address " << _myInt << " with _myInt = " << *_myInt << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    SharedCopy source(42);
    SharedCopy destination1(source);
    SharedCopy destination2(source);
    SharedCopy destination3(source);

    return 0;
}
```

The output of the program is the following:

```
resource allocated at address 0x100300060
2 instances with handles to address 0x100300060 with _myInt = 42
3 instances with handles to address 0x100300060 with _myInt = 42
4 instances with handles to address 0x100300060 with _myInt = 42
instance at address 0x7ffeefbff6f8 goes out of scope with _cnt = 3
instance at address 0x7ffeefbff700 goes out of scope with _cnt = 2
instance at address 0x7ffeefbff718 goes out of scope with _cnt = 1
resource freed at address 0x100300060
```

As can be seen, the memory is released only once as soon as the reference counter reaches zero.

The **Rule of Three** states that if a class needs to have an overloaded copy constructor, copy 
assignment operator, ~or~ destructor, then it must also implement the other two as well to ensure 
that memory is managed consistently.
