# 2. Foundations
## 1. Introduction to the C++ Language
```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using std::cout;
using std::ifstream;
using std::istringstream;
using std::string;
using std::vector;

enum class State {kEmpty, kObstacle};

vector<State> ParseLine(string line) {
    istringstream sline(line);
    int n;
    char c;
    vector<State> row;
    while (sline >> n >> c && c == ',') {
      if (n == 0) {
        row.push_back(State::kEmpty);
      } else {
        row.push_back(State::kObstacle);
      }
    }
    return row;
}
vector<vector<State>> ReadBoardFile(string path) {
  ifstream myfile (path);
  vector<vector<State>> board{};
  if (myfile) {
    string line;
    while (getline(myfile, line)) {
      vector<State> row = ParseLine(line);
      board.push_back(row);
    }
  }
  return board;
}
string CellString(State cell) {
  switch(cell) {
    case State::kObstacle: return "‚õ∞Ô∏è   ";
    default: return "0   "; 
  }
}
void PrintBoard(const vector<vector<State>> board) {
  for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < board[i].size(); j++) {
      cout << CellString(board[i][j]);
    }
    cout << "\n";
  }
}
int main() {
  auto board = ReadBoardFile("1.board");
  PrintBoard(board);
}
```
## 2. A* Search
### 2.1. Passing by Reference
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;


int MultiplyByTwo(int &i) {
    i = 2*i;
    return i;
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    cout << "The int a equals: " << a << "\n";
    int b = MultiplyByTwo(a);
    cout << "The int b equals: " << b << "\n";
    cout << "The int a now equals: " << a << "\n";
}
```
### 2.2. `const` vs. `constexpr`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    int i;
    std::cout << "Enter an integer value for i: ";
    std::cin >> i;
    const int j = i * 2;  // "j can only be evaluated at run time."
                          // "But I promise not to change it after it is initialized."
    constexpr int k = 3;  // "k, in contrast, can be evaluated at compile time."
    std::cout << "j = " << j << "\n";
    std::cout << "k = " << k << "\n";
}
```
### 2.3. Arrays vs. Vectors
Arrays are a lower level data structure than vectors, and can be slightly more efficient, in terms of memory and element access. However, this efficiency comes with a price. Unlike vectors, which can be extended with more elements, arrays have a fixed length. Additionally, arrays may require careful memory management, depending how they are used.

## 3. Writing Multifile Programs
### 3.1. Include Guard
there is a preprocessor directive:
```cpp
#ifndef HEADER_EXAMPLE_H
#define HEADER_EXAMPLE_H
```
at the top of the header, along with an `#endif` at the end. This is called an "include guard". Since the header will be included into another file, and #include just pastes contents into a file, the include guard prevents the same file from being pasted multiple times into another file. This might happen if multiple files include the same header, and then are all included into the same main.cpp, for example. The ifndef checks if HEADER_EXAMPLE_H has not been defined in the file already. If it has not been defined yet, then it is defined with #define HEADER_EXAMPLE_H, and the rest of the header is used. If HEADER_EXAMPLE_H has already been defined, then the preprocessor does not enter the ifndef block. 

Note: There are other ways to do this. Another common way is to use an `#pragma once` preprocessor directive.
### 3.2. Multifile Program Example
#### `vect_add_one.h` and `vect_add_one.cpp`
```cpp
#ifndef VECT_ADD_ONE_H
#define VECT_ADD_ONE_H
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
// AddOneToEach method declaration.
void AddOneToEach(vector<int> &v);
#endif
```
and
```cpp
#include "vect_add_one.h"
void AddOneToEach(vector<int> &v) 
{
    for (auto& i: v) {
        i++;
    }
}
```
#### `increment_and_sum.h` and `increment_and_sum.cpp`
```cpp
#ifndef INCREMENT_AND_SUM_H
#define INCREMENT_AND_SUM_H
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
// IncrementAndComputeVectorSum method declaration.
int IncrementAndComputeVectorSum(vector<int> v);
#endif
```
and
```cpp
#include "vect_add_one.h"

int IncrementAndComputeVectorSum(vector<int> v) {
    int total = 0;
    AddOneToEach(v);

    for (auto i: v) {
        total += i;
    }
    return total;
}
```
and `main.cpp` function:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include "increment_and_sum.h"
using std::vector;
using std::cout;

int main() 
{
    vector<int> v{1, 2, 3, 4};
    int total = IncrementAndComputeVectorSum(v);
    cout << "The total is: " << total << "\n";
}
```
### 3.3. References
A reference is another name given to an existing variable. On the left hand side of any variable declaration, the `&` operator can be used to declare a reference.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() 
{
    int i = 1;
    
    // Declare a reference to i.
    int& j = i;
    cout << "The value of j is: " << j << "\n";  //1
    
    // Change the value of i.
    i = 5;
    cout << "The value of i is changed to: " << i << "\n";   //5
    cout << "The value of j is now: " << j << "\n";    //5
    
    // Change the value of the reference.
    // Since reference is just another name for the variable,
    // th
    j = 7;
    cout << "The value of j is now: " << j << "\n";    //7
    cout << "The value of i is changed to: " << i << "\n";    //7
}
```
### 3.4. Pointers
A C++ pointer is just a variable that stores the memory address of an object in your program.
#### 3.4.1. Accessing a Memory Address
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() {
    int i = 5;
    int j = 6;
    
    // Print the memory addresses of i and j
    cout << "The address of i is: " << &i << "\n";
    cout << "The address of j is: " << &j << "\n";
}
```
#### 3.4.2. Storing a Memory Address
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() 
{
    int i = 5;
    // A pointer pointer_to_i is declared and initialized to the address of i.
    int* pointer_to_i = &i;
    
    // Print the memory addresses of i and j
    cout << "The address of i is:          " << &i << "\n";
    cout << "The variable pointer_to_i is: " << pointer_to_i << "\n";
}
```
#### 3.4.3. Dereferencing Operator - Getting an Object Back from a Pointer Address
Once you have a pointer, you may want to retrieve the object it is pointing to. In this case, the `*` symbol can be used again. This time, however, it will appear on the right hand side of an equation or in front of an already-defined variable, so the meaning is different. In this case, it is called the "dereferencing operator", and it returns the object being pointed to. You can see how this works with the code below:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int main() 
{
    int i = 5;
    // A pointer pointer_to_i is declared and initialized to the address of i.
    int* pointer_to_i = &i;
    
    // Print the memory addresses of i and j
    cout << "The address of i is:          " << &i << "\n";
    cout << "The variable pointer_to_i is: " << pointer_to_i << "\n";
    cout << "The value of the variable pointed to by pointer_to_i is: " << *pointer_to_i << "\n";
}
```
#### 3.4.4. Passing Pointers to a Function
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

void AddOne(int* j)
{
    // Dereference the pointer and increment the int being pointed to.
    (*j)++;
}

int main() 
{
    int i = 1;
    cout << "The value of i is: " << i << "\n";
    
    // Declare a pointer to i:
    int* pi = &i;
    AddOne(pi);
    cout << "The value of i is now: " << i << "\n";
}
```
#### 3.4.5. Returning a Pointer from a Function
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout;

int* AddOne(int& j) 
{
    // Increment the referenced int and return the
    // address of j.
    j++;
    return &j;
}

int main() 
{
    int i = 1;
    cout << "The value of i is: " << i << "\n";
    
    // Declare a pointer and initialize to the value
    // returned by AddOne:
    int* my_pointer = AddOne(i);
    cout << "The value of i is now: " << i << "\n";
    cout << "The value of the int pointed to by my_pointer is: " << *my_pointer << "\n";
}
```
### 3.5. References vs Pointers
#### Similarities
* Both references and pointers can be used in pass-by-reference to a function.
* They both provide an alternative way to access an existing variable: pointers through the variable's address, and references through another name for that variable.
#### Diferences
| References | Pointers |
| ---- | ---- |
References must be initialized when they are declared. This means that a reference will always point to data that was intentionally assigned to it. | Pointers can be declared without being initialized, which is dangerous. If this happens mistakenly, the pointer could be pointing to an arbitrary address in memory, and the data associated with that address could be meaningless, leading to undefined behavior and difficult-to-resolve bugs.
References can not be null. This means that a reference should point to meaningful data in the program. | Pointers can be null. In fact, if a pointer is not initialized immediately, it is often best practice to initialize to nullptr, a special type which indicates that the pointer is null.
When used in a function for pass-by-reference, the reference can be used just as a variable of the same type would be. | When used in a function for pass-by-reference, a pointer must be dereferenced in order to access the underlying object.

* References are generally easier and safer than pointers.
### 3.6. Maps (`unordered_map`)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using std::vector;
using std::cout;
using std::unordered_map;
using std::string;

int main() {
    // Create strings to use in the hash table.
    string key = "word";
    string def_1 = "a unit of language, consisting of one or more spoken sounds or their written representation, that functions as a principal carrier of meaning";
    string def_2 = "speech or talk: to express one's emotion in words";
    string def_3 = "a short talk or conversation: 'Marston, I'd like a word with you.'";
    string def_4 = "an expression or utterance: a word of warning";
    unordered_map <string, vector<string>> my_dictionary;

    // Check if key is in the hash table.
    if (my_dictionary.find(key) == my_dictionary.end()) {
        cout << "The key 'word' is not in the dictionary." << "\n";
        cout << "Inserting a key-value pair into the dictionary." << "\n\n";
        // Set the value for the key.
        my_dictionary[key] = vector<string> {def_1, def_2, def_3, def_4};
    }

    // The key should now be in the hash table. You can access the
    // value corresponding to the key with square brackets [].
    // Here, the value my_dictionary[key] is a vector of strings.
    // We iterate over the vector and print the strings.
    cout << key << ": \n";
    auto definitions = my_dictionary[key];
    for (string definition : definitions) {
        cout << definition << "\n";
    }
}
```
### 3.7. `->` Operator
The arrow operator `->` is used to simultaneously
* dereference a pointer to an object and
* access an attribute or method.
For example, in the code below, `cp` is a pointer to a `Car` object, and the following two are equivalent:
```cpp
// Simultaneously dereference the pointer and 
// access IncrementDistance().
cp->IncrementDistance();
```
```cpp
// Dereference the pointer using *, then 
// access IncrementDistance() with traditional 
// dot notation.
(*cp).IncrementDistance();
```
### 3.8. A little OOP
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include "car.h"
using std::string;
using std::cout;
using std::vector;

int main() {
    // Create an empty vector of pointers to Cars 
    // and a null pointer to a car.
    vector<Car*> car_vect;
    Car* cp = nullptr;
    
    // The vector of colors for the cars:
    vector<string> colors {"red", "blue", "green"};

    // Create 100 cars with different colors and 
    // push pointers to each of those cars into the vector.
    for (int i=0; i < 100; i++) {;
        cp = new Car(colors[i%3], i+1);
        car_vect.push_back(cp);
    }

    // Move each car forward by 1.
    for (Car* cp: car_vect) {
        cp->IncrementDistance();
    }

    // Print data about each car.
    for (Car* cp: car_vect) {
        cp->PrintCarData();
    }
}
```
### 3.9. `this` Pointer
```cpp
// The Car class
class Car {
  public:
    // Method to print data.
    void PrintCarData() {
        cout << "The distance that the " << this->color << " car " << this->number << " has traveled is: " << this->distance << "\n";
    }

    // Method to increment the distance travelled.
    void IncrementDistance() {
        this->distance++;
    }

    // Class/object attributes
    string color;
    int distance = 0;
    int number;
};
```
